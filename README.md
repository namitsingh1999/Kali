# MAC address changer allows you to automatically change the MAC address for any interface without having to type several commands all you have to do is literally just navigate to the directory on which you cloned this git and type a single command that is and this applies to all the codes that I've wriiten, Furthermore if you still find any trouble running my other programs just type "python [program name].py --help:
python3 mac_changer.py --interface [interface name for which mac address has to be changed] --mac [new MAC address]
